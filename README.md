## Motivation

This project has been created as a part of the Udacity Nanodegree Data Scientist program. An [article](https://blurp) has been posted on Medium to share the findings.



## Dependencies
## adsf
### dfsf




## Structure

The directory structure for this project looks like follows:

    boston_aribnb
    ├── dataset

### Results

Podsumowanie modelu i odpowiedź na pytania














Project follows the CRISP-DM process outlined for questions through communication. This can be done in the README or the notebook. If a question does not require machine learning, descriptive or inferential statistics should be used to create a compelling answer to a particular question.




    


Student must have a Github repository of their project. The repository must have a README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgements. Students should not use another student's code to complete the project, but they may use other references on the web including StackOverflow and Kaggle to complete the project.
